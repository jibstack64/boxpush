# boxpush

#### A fun command-line game where you push boxes!
> `boxpush` is still in development. There are many bugs that are yet to be patched, and because of this, the current release has been marked as a pre-release.

### How to play?
- You, the smiley face, push boxes across the map onto the crosses.
- When a point is scored, the box turns green and the `Score` counter is incremented by one.
- A big mistake is pushing a box onto the wall - doing this will prevent you from moving it off.
- Once all boxes are on a target, you will be taken to the next level.

### Controls
- `w/a/s/d` - Up, down, left, right.
- `r` - Resets the level you are on.

### Extra
- There are `*nix` and `Windows 7+` builds with every release.
- The Windows build uses non-unicode characters as the (rather mediocre) PS/CM does not support them.
